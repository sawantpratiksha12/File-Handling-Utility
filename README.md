**Task 1 – File Handling Utility helped me gain practical knowledge of Java file operations. In this project, I developed a Java application that can read, write, and modify text files. The main aim was to understand how data can be stored permanently in files instead of only working with temporary variables in memory.
Through this task, I learned how to use important Java classes like File, FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, and BufferedWriter. I understood how to create a file, add content to it, read the stored data, and update existing information. This gave me hands-on experience with file streams and improved my understanding of input and output operations.
Additionally, I improved my debugging skills while testing different file operations. Whenever errors occurred, I analyzed the issue, identified the mistake, and corrected it. This process increased my confidence in troubleshooting and refining my code independently.
One of the key learnings from this project was exception handling. I learned how to manage errors such as file not found or input/output exceptions using try-catch blocks. This helped me write more stable and error-free programs.The project also improved my logical thinking and problem-solving skills. I had to design the program in a structured way and ensure that user inputs were handled correctly. It increased my confidence in building Java applications independently.
Another important benefit of this project was learning about real-world application development practices. File handling is widely used in many software systems, such as record management systems, logging systems, and data storage applications. By building this utility, I gained practical exposure to how such systems function at a basic level.
Overall, Task 1 helped me bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical implementation. It strengthened my foundation in core Java, improved my confidence in coding, and enhanced my ability to develop small but meaningful applications.this task helped me connect theoretical concepts with real-world implementation and strengthened my foundation in core Java programming.**
